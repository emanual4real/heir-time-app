# Heir Time

This is a personal project I'm working on for my mom.  She wants to start planning our inheritance as well as just de-cluttering things that we (millenials) have no interest in.  
The application will allow a user to post items with pictures and relevant information while other users will bid on their desire for the item.  Planned functionality will be that the
owner of the item will decide who it goes to.
